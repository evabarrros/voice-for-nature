## Have you ever thought about how the relationship with nature has shaped the development of the Netherlands, TU Delft Campus, and Deltares throughout history?

The relationship between the Dutch and their environment began centuries ago, shaped by necessity and innovation. During the Medieval Period (9th-12th Century), the Dutch initiated land reclamation from the sea, employing early polder systems and constructing dikes to protect settlements from flooding. This marked the beginning of Dutch expertise in land and water management, laying the foundation for future landscape development.

By the 17th Century, the Netherlands had refined its water management techniques, ushering in the Golden Age of Dutch Landscape Engineering. The iconic Dutch landscape flat, reclaimed land dotted with windmills, dikes, and canals became a hallmark of human intervention in nature. This period reflected a careful balance between the natural world and human ingenuity.

The founding of TU Delft in 1842 was a pivotal moment in this narrative. Established as a technical institution, TU Delft aimed to educate engineers in fields like water management and civil engineering, both essential to Dutch landscape development. In its early years, the campus focused more on infrastructure, with little attention to green spaces or biodiversity. The urban nature of the campus likely supported common city-dwelling species such as pigeons, crows, and sparrows.

In the 20th Century, as global awareness of environmental sustainability grew, TU Delft evolved into a leader in sustainable development research. The institution became heavily involved in exploring renewable energy and engineering solutions that respected natural forces, continuing the Dutch tradition of water management. Since the 1990s, there has been a shift toward integrating sustainability into urban design. TU Delft introduced several ecological initiatives, including green rooftops, water management systems that encourage biodiversity, and the creation of diverse habitats. These efforts supported an increase in wildlife, attracting birds like starlings, blackbirds, and migratory waterfowl, along with insects like bees and butterflies.

Today, TU Delft campus embodies nature-inclusive design. The integration of biodiversity into architectural and landscape planning, along with the use of native plants and insect-friendly gardens, has made the campus a thriving hub for ecological diversity. Bird populations, including common urban species and water-dwelling birds like herons and swans, flourish, while a variety of insects and small mammals benefit from the habitat-friendly design. This approach mirrors the work of Deltares, where sustainable water management and ecological integration are central to the research and innovation that address global environmental challenges. Together, TU Delft and Deltares exemplify how academia and applied research can harmonize with nature, influencing both urban and water-based ecosystems.
